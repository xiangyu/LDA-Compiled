000301685300003	X	"The effect of atmospheric adsorbates, composed of dry oxygen (O-2) and ambient air, on electrical transport in high-quality and moderate-quality graphene samples was investigated. Atmospheric doping is seen to affect different samples at different rates but in all samples hole-doping is observed within several minutes of O-2 or ambient exposure. After an initial rapid increase, the doping rate falls off dramatically. It is shown that carrier mobility (mu) can be either improved or degraded depending on the nature of the impurities affecting transport. The former case represents the first experimental demonstration of an improvement in carrier mobility with increased doping in graphene. A model is derived to understand the interplay between charge screening and impurity scattering. The study points to the possibility that oxygen and water molecules mitigate carrier scattering from negatively-charged impurities but cause increased carrier scattering from positivelycharged impurities.

Our methodology is divided into three steps: 1) pre-layout optimization; 2) placement and routing; and 3) post-layout optimization. We show that our methodology generates layouts with small area and good performance response within a fraction of design time compared with fully manual design effort. We make use of circuit models to represent and optimize the physical layout of the resistance-inductance-capacitance (RLC) components as well as the entire RF circuit that uses them. We perform non-linear mathematical programming-based optimization at various stages of the methodology to achieve high quality layouts. Full wave electromagnetic simulations are kept completely out of the design loop, so our methodology significantly reduces design time.

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of negatively-charged heparin in priming hydrogel-encapsulated MSCs toward the osteoblastic lineage during coculture with a monolayer of osteoblasts in the absence of dexamethasone. MSCs encapsulated with higher amounts of heparin and cocultured with osteoblasts exhibited an over 36-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and 13-fold increase in calcium accumulation by day 21, compared to MSCs cocultured with MSCs at the same heparin content. Moreover, hydrogels with higher amounts of heparin and cocultured with osteoblasts exhibited enhanced mineralization on the edges, suggesting that heparin may be important in sequestering osteoblast-secreted soluble factors, particularly on the surfaces of hydrogels. The ability of heparin to selectively interact with soluble positively-charged proteins from the surroundings was confirmed through protein labeling and microscopy. These results suggest that heparin-containing hydrogels as part of a coculture system can be utilized as a versatile platform to study and enhance priming of MSCs toward various cell types for a wide variety of regenerative medicine-based therapies.; Differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in heparin-containing hydrogels via coculture with osteoblasts"

Successful bone repair approaches may include an osteoconductive scaffold, osteoinductive growth factors, cells with an osteogenic potential and capacity for graft vascularisation. To increase osteoinductivity of biomaterials, the local combination and delivery of growth factors has been developed. In the present study we investigated the osteogenic effects of calcium phosphate (CaP)-coated nanofiber mesh tube-mediated delivery of BMP-7 from a PRP matrix for the regeneration of critical sized segmental bone defects in a small animal model. Bilateral full-thickness diaphyseal segmental defects were created in twelve male Lewis rats and nanofiber mesh tubes were placed around the defect. Defects received either treatment with a CaP-coated nanofiber mesh tube (n=6), an un-coated nanofiber mesh tube (n=6) a CaP-coated nanofiber mesh tube with PRP (n=6) or a CaP-coated nanofiber mesh tube in combination with 5 mu g BMP-7 and PRP (n=6). After 12 weeks, bone volume and biomechanical properties were evaluated using radiography, microCT, biomechanical testing and histology. The results demonstrated significantly higher biomechanical properties and bone volume for the BMP group compared to the control groups. These results were supported by the histological evaluations, where BMP group showed the highest rate of bone regeneration within the defect. In conclusion, BMP-7 delivery via PRP enhanced functional bone defect regeneration, and together these data support the use of BMP-7 in the treatment of critical sized defects.; Biomimetic tubular nanofiber mesh and platelet rich plasma-mediated delivery of BMP-7 for large bone defect regeneration"

In this study, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) spheroids, or ""mesenspheres"", of different sizes, were formed using a forced aggregation technique and maintained in suspension culture for extended periods of time thereafter. Cell proliferation and differentiation potential within mesenspheres and dissociated cells retrieved from spheroids were compared to conventional adherent monolayer cultures. Mesenspheres maintained in growth medium exhibited no evidence of cell necrosis or differentiation, while mesenspheres in differentiation media exhibited differentiation similar to conventional 2D culture methods based on histological markers of osteogenic and adipogenic commitment. Furthermore, when plated onto tissue culture plates, cells that had been cultured within mesenspheres in growth medium recovered morphology typical of cells cultured continuously in adherent monolayers and retained their capacity for multilineage differentiation potential. In fact, more robust matrix mineralization and lipid vacuole content were evident in recovered MSCs when compared to monolayers, suggesting enhanced differentiation by cells cultured as 3D spheroids. Thus, this study demonstrates the development of a 3D culture system for mesenchymal stem cells that may circumvent limitations associated with conventional monolayer cultures and enhance the differentiation potential of multipotent cells.; Scaffold-free culture of mesenchymal stem cell spheroids in suspension preserves multilineage potential"

VEGF induces new vessel formation and tumor growth by inducing mitogenesis and chemotaxis of normal endothelial cells and increasing vascular permeability. However, little is known about VEGF function in the proliferation, survival or migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC). In the present study, we have found that VEGF receptors are expressed in HCC line BEL7402 and human HCC specimens. Importantly, VEGF receptor expression correlates with the development of the carcinoma. By using a comprehensive approaches including TUNEL assay, transwell and wound healing assays, migration and invasion assays, adhesion assay, western blot and quantitative RT-PCR, we have shown that knockdown of VEGF165 expression by shRNA inhibits the proliferation, migration, survival and adhesion ability of BEL7402. Knockdown of VEGF165 decreased the expression of NF-kappa B p65 and PKC alpha while increased the expression of p53 signaling molecules, suggesting that VEGF functions in HCC proliferation and migration are mediated by P65, PKC alpha and/or p53.; VEGF is essential for the growth and migration of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells"

It thus makes a wealth of existing knowledge available for the study of rotationally faulted graphene multilayers. Agreement of this theory with a recent experiment in a strong magnetic field was demonstrated. Here we explore some of the predictions of this theory for the system in zero magnetic field at large interlayer bias, when it becomes local in space.

The model parameters are effective energy barriers for the nucleation and propagation of graphene at the SiC steps. When the model is applied to graphene growth on vicinal surfaces, a strip width distribution is used to characterize the surface morphology. Additional kinetic processes are included to study graphene growth on SiC nano-facets. Our main result is that the original nano-facet is fractured into several nano-facets during graphene growth. This phenomenon is characterized by the angle at which the fractured nano-facet is oriented with respect to the basal plane. The distribution of this angle across the surface is found to be related to the strip width distribution for vicinal surfaces. As the terrace propagation barrier decreases, the fracture angle distribution changes continuously from two-sided Gaussian to one-sided power law. Using this distribution, it will be possible to extract energy barriers from experiments and interpret the growth morphology quantitatively.; Model and simulations of the epitaxial growth of graphene on non-planar 6H-SiC surfaces"

Because rapid evolution of the influenza A viruses persistently complicates the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics, a further understanding of the complex host cell pathways coopted by influenza virus for replication may provide new targets and strategies for antiviral therapy.

We report here a novel approach that greatly enhances piezoelectric power generation by introducing a p-type polymer layer on a piezoelectric semiconducting thin film. Holes at the film surface greatly reduce the piezoelectric potential screening effect caused by free electrons in a piezoelectric semiconducting material. Furthermore, additional carriers from a conducting polymer and a shift in the Fermi level help in increasing the power output. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was used as a p-type polymer on piezoelectric semiconducting zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film, and phenyl-C-61-butyric add methyl ester (PCBM) was added to P3HT to improve carrier transport. The ZnO/P3HT:PCBM-assembled piezoelectric power generator demonstrated 18-fold enhancement in the output voltage and tripled the current, relative to a power generator with ZnO only at a strain of 0.068%. The overall output power density exceeded 0.88 W/cm(3), and the average power conversion efficiency was up to 18%.

The effects on the polymer crystal structure of varying the alkyl side-chain length from C-12 to C-14 and C-16 are also studied. The accurate determination of the three-dimensional polymer structure allows us to examine the PBTTT electronic band structure and intermolecular electronic couplings (transfer integrals) as a function of alkyl side-chain length.

The commercialization of scientific discoveries such as graphene is inherently uncertain, with the lag time between the scientific development of a new technology and its adoption by corporate actors revealing the extent to which firms are able to absorb knowledge and engage in learning to implement applications based on the new technology. From this perspective, we test for the existence of three different corporate learning and activity patterns: (1) a linear process where patenting follows scientific discovery; (2) a double-boom phenomenon where corporate (patenting) activity is first concentrated in technological improvements and then followed by a period of technology productization; and (3) a concurrent model where scientific discovery in publications occurs in parallel with patenting.

Like many tissues, neovascular networks have been shown in vitro to be highly sensitive to mechanical conditions; however, the effects of matrix deformations on neovascular network formation and remodeling in engineered tissue regeneration in vivo have not been evaluated. We quantified the effects of early and delayed functional loading on neovascular growth in a rat model of large bone defect regeneration using compliant fixation plates that were unlocked to allow transfer of ambulatory loads to the defect either at the time of implantation (early), or after 4wk of stiff fixation (delayed). Neovascular growth and bone regeneration were quantitatively evaluated 3 wk after the onset of loading by contrast-enhanced microcomputed tomography and histology. The initial vascular response to bone injury featured robust angiogenesis and collateral vessel formation, increasing parameters such as vascular volume and connectivity while decreasing degree of anisotropy. Application of early mechanical loading significantly inhibited vascular invasion into the defect by 66% and reduced bone formation by 75% in comparison to stiff plate controls. In contrast, delaying the onset of loading by 4 wk significantly enhanced bone formation by 20% and stimulated vascular remodeling by increasing the number of large vessels and decreasing the number of small vessels.

For this purpose, we first develop a new hysteretic scheme that improves upon existing nonlinear site response models by allowing adjustment of the width and length of the hysteresis loop for a relatively small number of soil parameters. The constitutive law is formulated to approximate the response of saturated cohesive materials, and does not account for volumetric changes due to shear leading to pore pressure development and potential liquefaction. We implement the soil model in the forward operator of the inversion, and evaluate the constitutive parameters that maximize the cross-correlation between site response predictions and observations on ground surface. The objective function is defined in the wavelet domain, which allows equal weight to be assigned across all frequency bands of the non-stationary signal. We evaluate the convergence rate and robustness of the proposed scheme for noise-free and noise-contaminated data, and illustrate good performance of the inversion for signal-to-noise ratios as low as 3. We finally employ the proposed scheme to downhole array data, and show that results compare very well with published data on generic soil conditions and previous geotechnical investigation studies at the array site. By assuming a realistic hysteretic model and estimating the constitutive soil parameters, the proposed inversion accounts for the instantaneous adjustment of soil response to the level and strain and load path during transient loading, and allows results to be used in predictions of nonlinear site effects during future events.; A Wavelet-based Seismogram Inversion Algorithm for the In Situ Characterization of Nonlinear Soil Behavior"

The runway planning problem is modeled as a process in two stages, where the first stage uses a two-stage stochastic program to find an aircraft weight-class sequence that maximizes throughput while simultaneously achieving a desirable sequence for the second planning stage without having exact information on the stochastic parameters. In the second planning stage, individual aircraft are assigned to the sequence after exact information becomes available.

But there is little research on comparative study between sequential zoning and simultaneous zoning. In order to help the designers to choose the suitable zoning policy for picker-to-parts system reasonably and quickly, a systemic selection method is presented. Essentially, both zoning and batching are order clustering, so the customer order sheet can be divided into many unit grids. After the time formulation in one-dimensional unit was defined, the time models for each zoning policy in two-dimensional space were established using filling curves and sequence models to link the one-dimensional unit grids. in consideration of ""U"" shaped dual tour into consideration, the subtraction value of order picking time between sequential zoning and simultaneous zoning was defined as the objective function to select the suitable zoning policy based on time models. As it is convergent enough, genetic algorithm is adopted to find the optimal value of order picking time. In the experimental study, 5 different kinds of order/stock keeping unit(SKU) matrices with different densities d and quantities q following uniform distribution were created in order to test the suitability of sequential zoning and simultaneous zoning to different kinds of orders. After parameters setting, experimental orders inputting and iterative computations, the optimal order picking time for each zoning policy was gotten.

The special pentagon-hexagonal graphene shells have been produced by precipitation of carbon from metal carbide solutions, thanks to the high reactivity of GONs and ferric nanoparticles dispersing homogeneously between graphene layers. The morphology, structure and elemental composition of GEIMs were investigated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and electron energy disperse spectroscope, respectively. The formation mechanism of GEIMs was proposed. Hollow graphene microspheres (HGMs) on the GNSs were obtained with the removal of ferric species in GEIMs. When used as the anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, the almost graphitic HGMs exhibit stable voltage platform at ca. 0.2 V, excellent cycle capability and higher reversible capacity of about 440 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles and possess great potential application in lithium-ion batteries.; Graphene-encapsulated iron microspheres on the graphene nanosheets"

The device is based on a multilayer, micron-scale, low-resistance metallic skeleton with an improved surface area. This skeleton consists of alternating Cu and Ni layers supporting Zn as electrodeposited anode electrode, and provides a high surface area, low-resistance path for electron transfer. A proof-of-concept zinc-air microbattery based on this technology was developed, characterized and compared with its two-dimensional thin-film counterparts fabricated on the same footprint area with equal amount of the Zn anode electrode. Using this approach, we were able to improve a single-layer initial structure with a surface area of 1.3 mm(2) to a scaffold structure with ten layers having a surface area of 15 mm2.

We have examined key factors responsible for damage to rat embryonic neural cells during cryopreservation using a two-step temperature profile, with an emphasis on the effects of cooling rate and plunge temperature. Our results indicate that the initial addition of 8% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and seeding of extracellular ice do not significantly decrease viable cell yield. However, subsequent freezing resulted in significant cell losses for all profile parameter combinations examined. A maximum post-thaw survival of 56% (compared to unfrozen controls) was observed after cooling at 2 degrees C/min to -80 degrees C followed by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. Single-step removal of DMSO after thawing was associated with an additional 40-70% loss of viable cells, and the number of viable cells was further reduced by approximately 70% after 2 days of cell culture (resulting in a net viable cell yield of 9.6 +/- 0.4%). Nonetheless, the cryopreserved neurons that did survive displayed a normal morphology, including formation of neurites. Trends in neuronal viability conformed with predictions of existing theoretical models of cell freezing, with reduced survival for rapid cooling rates or high plunge temperatures (attributable to intracellular ice formation), and decreasing viability with increasing profile duration (consistent with the known effects of cell dehydration at suboptimal cooling rates). These observations suggest that neural cells are good candidates for further refinement of freezing profile design using a physics-based approach to parameter optimization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

000295790400018	X	"The impedance of the power distribution network (PDN) needs to be minimized in order to prevent unwanted voltage fluctuations at frequencies where current transients occur. To reduce PDN impedance, one can place decoupling capacitors that act as local current sources. However, selecting and placing the right capacitors at the right locations are problematic because of the complexity of modern package and board structures. In addition, decoupling capacitors are not effective at higher frequencies, requiring more complicated techniques such as embedded decoupling. This paper introduces a method of reducing the effort expended by the complex task of decoupling capacitor placement: a genetic algorithm that is customized for the selection and placement of decoupling capacitors. The core engine of this optimizing algorithm is a recently developed technique, the multilayer finite element method (MFEM), which solves for PDN impedances. This paper also highlights a method of incorporating vertical circuit elements into MFEM. Using several test cases, it proves the validity of the inclusion of vertical elements in MFEM and the effectiveness of the optimizer.; Decoupling Capacitor Placement in Power Delivery Networks Using MFEM"
000295841200029	X	"Two new fields are introduced to MEMS/NEMS: a nanogenerator that harvests mechanical energy for powering nanosystems, and strained induced piezotronics for smart MEMS. Fundamentally, due to the polarization of ions in a crystal that has non-central symmetry, such as ZnO, GaN and InN, a piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) is created in the crystal by applying a stress. The principle of harvesting irregular mechanical energy by the nanogenerator relies on the piezopotenital driven transient flow of electrons in external load, which can be resulted from body motion, muscle stretching, breathing, tiny mechanical vibration/disturbance, sonic wave etc. As of today, a gentle straining can output 1-3 V at an instant output power of similar to 2 mu W from an integrated nanogenerator of a very thin sheet of 1 cm(2) in size. This technology has the potential applications for power MEMS/NEMS that requires a power in the mu W to mW range. Furthermore, we have replaced the externally applied gate voltage to a CMOS field effect transistor by the strain induced piezopotential as a ""gate"" voltage to tune/control the charge transport from source to drain.

While adhesion to RGD peptides has been shown to inhibit in vitro chondrogenesis, the effects of extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimetic ligands with complex secondary and tertiary structures are unknown. This study aimed to determine whether collagen- and fibronectin-mimetic ligands would retain biologic functionality in three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels, whether different ECM-mimetic ligands differentially influence in vitro chondrogenesis, and if effects of ligands on differentiation depend on soluble biochemical stimuli. A linear RGD peptide, a recombinant fibronectin fragment containing the seven to ten Type III repeats (FnIII7-10) and a triple helical, collagen mimetic peptide with the GFOGER motif were covalently coupled to agarose gels using the sulfo-SANPAH crosslinker, and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were cultured within the 3D hydrogels. The ligands retained biologic functionality within the agarose gels and promoted density-dependent BMSC spreading. Interactions with all adhesive ligands inhibited stimulation by chondrogenic factors of collagen Type II and aggrecan mRNA levels and deposition of sulfated glycosaminoglycans. In medium containing fetal bovine serum, interactions with the GFOGER peptide enhanced mRNA expression of the osteogenic gene osteocalcin whereas FnIII7-10 inhibited osteocalcin expression. In conclusion, modification of agarose hydrogels with ECM-mimetic ligands can influence the differentiation of BMSCs in a manner that depends strongly on the presence and nature of soluble biochemical stimuli.; FIBRONECTIN- AND COLLAGEN-MIMETIC LIGANDS REGULATE BONE MARROW STROMAL CELL CHONDROGENESIS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL HYDROGELS"
000295973800013	X	"After the pioneering investigations into graphene-based electronics at Georgia Tech, great strides have been made developing epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide (EG) as a new electronic material. EG has not only demonstrated its potential for large scale applications, it also has become an important material for fundamental two-dimensional electron gas physics. It was long known that graphene mono and multilayers grow on SiC crystals at high temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum. At these temperatures, silicon sublimes from the surface and the carbon rich surface layer transforms to graphene. However the quality of the graphene produced in ultrahigh vacuum is poor due to the high sublimation rates at relatively low temperatures. The Georgia Tech team developed growth methods involving encapsulating the SiC crystals in graphite enclosures, thereby sequestering the evaporated silicon and bringing growth process closer to equilibrium. In this confinement controlled sublimation (CCS) process, very high-quality graphene is grown on both polar faces of the SiC crystals. Since 2003, over 50 publications used CCS grown graphene, where it is known as the ""furnace grown"" graphene. Graphene multilayers grown on the carbon-terminated face of SiC, using the CCS method, were shown to consist of decoupled high mobility graphene layers. The CCS method is now applied on structured silicon carbide surfaces to produce high mobility nano-patterned graphene structures thereby demonstrating that EG is a viable contender for next-generation electronics. Here we present for the first time the CCS method that outperforms other epitaxial graphene production methods.; Large area and structured epitaxial graphene produced by confinement controlled sublimation of silicon carbide"

A critical insight in June 2001 brought to light that graphene could be used for electronics. This was followed by a series of proposals and measurements cumulating in a comprehensive patent for graphene-based electronics filed in 2003. The Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) graphene electronics research project group selected epitaxial graphene as the most viable route for graphene-based electronics, as described in their 2004 paper on transport and structural measurements of epitaxial graphene. Subsequently, the field developed rapidly, and multilayer graphene was discovered at GIT. This material consists of many graphene layers, but it is not graphite; in contrast to graphite, the layers are rotated with respect to each other, causing electronic decoupling so that each layer has the electronic structure of graphene.

Since the hybrid cell is designed by coupled piezoelectric and photoconductive properties of ZnO, this is a naturally hybrid architecture without crosstalk and an additional assembling process to create multi-type energy scavengers, thus differing from a simple integration of two different energy generators. It is demonstrated that the behavior of a piezoelectric output is controlled from alternating current (AC) type to direct current (DC)-like type by tailoring mechanical straining processes both in the dark and under light illumination. Based on such controllability of output modes, it is shown that the performance of the hybrid cell is synergistically enhanced by integrating the contribution made by a piezoelectric generator with a solar cell under a normal indoor level of illumination. Our approach clearly demonstrates the potential of the hybrid approach for scavenging multi-type energies whenever and wherever they are available. Furthermore, this work establishes the methodology to harvest solar energy and low-frequency mechanical energies such as body movements, making it possible to produce a promising multi-functional power generator that could be embedded in flexible architectures.; Control of naturally coupled piezoelectric and photovoltaic properties for multi-type energy scavengers"

Current widespread use of shRNA as a means to perturb specific redox couples may be misinterpreted if the targeted effects are not monitored in the context of potential global remodeling of the redox enzyme network. Results: Stable cell lines containing shRNA targets for glutaredoxin 1, thioredoxin 1, or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were generated in order to examine the changes in expression associated with altering cytosolic redox couples. A qRT PCR array revealed systemic off-target effects of altered antioxidant capacity and reactive oxygen species formation. Empty lentiviral particles generated numerous enzyme expression changes in comparison to uninfected cells, indicating an alteration in antioxidant capacity irrespective of a shRNA target. Of the three redox couples perturbed, glutaredoxin 1, attenuation produced the most numerous off-target effects with 10/28 genes assayed showing statistically significant changes. A multivariate analysis extracted strong covariance between glutaredoxin 1 and peroxiredoxin 2 which was subsequently experimentally verified. Computational modeling of the peroxide clearance dynamics associated with the remodeling of the redox network indicated that the compromised antioxidant capacity compared across the knockdown cell lines was unequally affected by the changes in expression of off-target proteins. Conclusions: Our results suggest that targeted reduction of redox enzyme expression leads to widespread changes in off-target protein expression, changes that are well-insulated between sub-cellular compartments, but compensatory in both the production of and protection against intracellular reactive oxygen species. Our observations suggest that the use of lentivirus can in itself have off-target effects on dynamic responses to oxidative stress due to the changes in species concentrations.; Systemic remodeling of the redox regulatory network due to RNAi perturbations of glutaredoxin 1, thioredoxin 1, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase"

Here we present evidence that the biogenesis of acidocalcisomes in Trypanosoma brucei is linked to the expression of adaptor protein-3 (AP-3) complex. Localization studies in cell lines expressing beta 3 and delta subunits of AP-3 fused to epitope tags revealed their partial co-localization with the vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase, a marker of acidocalcisomes, with the Golgi marker Golgi reassembly and stacking protein, and with antibodies against the small GTPase Rab11. Ablation of the beta 3 subunit by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in disappearance of acidocalcisomes from both procyclic and bloodstream form trypanosomes, as revealed by immmunofluorescence and electron microscopy assays, with no alterations in trafficking of different markers to lysosomes. Knockdown of the beta 3 subunit resulted in lower acidic calcium, pyrophosphate, and polyphosphate content as well as defects in growth in culture, resistance to osmotic stress, and virulence in mice. Similar results were obtained by knocking down the expression of the delta subunit of AP-3.

Experiments performed over a wide temperature range agree well with the theoretical model. It is shown that for extended stress periods, the algebraic sum of the pull-out voltages is thermally activated, and follows the same temperature trend as the voltage corresponding to the minimum capacitance of the switch. Since pull-out voltages can be measured accurately with little effort, this discovery significantly simplifies the study of thermally-activated processes in these switches.

The screening effect on the piezoelectric field caused by the free carriers in vertically compressed zinc oxide nanowires (NWs) has been computed by means of both analytical considerations and finite element calculations. We predict that, for typical geometries and donor concentrations, the length of the NW does not significantly influence the maximum output piezopotential because the potential mainly drops across the tip, so that relatively short NWs can be sufficient for high-efficiency nanogenerators, which is an important result for wet-chemistry fabrication of low-cost, CMOS- or MEMS-compatible nanogenerators. Furthermore, simulations reveal that the dielectric surrounding the NW influences the output piezopotential, especially for low donor concentrations.

At the nanoscale, a nanomachine is considered as the most basic functional unit which is able to perform very simple tasks. Communication among nanomachines will allow them to accomplish more complex functions in a distributed manner. In this paper, the state of the art in molecular electronics is reviewed to motivate the study of the Terahertz Band (0.1-10.0 THz) for electromagnetic (EM) communication among nano-devices. A new propagation model for EM communications in the Terahertz Band is developed based on radiative transfer theory and in light of molecular absorption. This model accounts for the total path loss and the molecular absorption noise that a wave in the Terahertz Band suffers when propagating over very short distances. Finally, the channel capacity of the Terahertz Band is investigated by using this model for different power allocation schemes, including a scheme based on the transmission of femtosecond-long pulses.

TbRab7 defines discrete late endosomes closely juxtaposed to the terminal p67(+) lysosome. RNAi indicates that TbRab7 is essential in bloodstream trypanosomes. Initial rates of endocytosis were unaffected, but lysosomal delivery of cargo, including tomato lectin (TL) and trypanolytic factor (TLF) were blocked. These accumulate in a dispersed internal compartment of elevated pH, likely derived from the late endosome. Surface binding of TL but not TLF was reduced, suggesting that cellular distribution of flagellar pocket receptors is differentially regulated by TbRab7. TLF activity was reduced approximately threefold confirming that lysosomal delivery is critical for trypanotoxicity. Unexpectedly, delivery of endogenous proteins, p67 and TbCatL, were unaffected indicating that TbRab7 does not regulate biosynthetic lysosomal trafficking. Thus, unlike mammalian cells and yeast, lysosomal trafficking of endocytosed and endogenous proteins occur via different routes and/or are regulated differentially. TbRab7 silencing had no effect on a cryptic default pathway to the lysosome, suggesting that the default lysosomal reporters p67 Delta TM, p67 Delta CD and VSG Delta GPI do not utilize the endocytic pathway as previously proposed.

Using electron beam lithography and the negative tone resist hydrogen silsesquioxane, we are able to observe the doping contribution from the passivation of such defects that naturally reside along the edge of graphene sheets, and directly compare them to the doping limitations of basal plane adsorption methods. We demonstrate that the passivation of the edge is over three orders of magnitude more efficient for chemical doping than adsorption, in terms of conducting carriers donated per available C-atom. Moreover, as large-area graphene sheets are tailored into nanoscale devices, and the portion of C-atoms that occupy the edge increases, we demonstrate that edge decoration becomes a more pronounced method of chemical doping, exhibiting a scaling law that will induce vast carrier densities and dominance over adsorption techniques in the nanoscale.

Recent advances in micro-scale technologies to control multi-cellular aggregate formation typically require chemical modification of the interface between cells and materials and lack multi-scale flexibility. Here we demonstrate that simple physical entrapment of magnetic microparticles within the extracellular space of stem cells spheroids during initial formation enables scaffold-free immobilization, translocation and directed assembly of multi-cellular aggregates across multiple length and time scales, even under dynamic suspension culture conditions. The response of aggregates to externally applied magnetic fields was a direct function of microparticle incorporation, allowing for rapid and transient control of the extracellular environment as well as separation of heterogeneous populations. In addition, spatial patterning of heterogeneous spheroid populations as well as individual multi-cellular aggregates was readily achieved by imposing temporary magnetic fields.

The experiments complemented by microscopic modeling reveal that the carrier relaxation is significantly slowed down as the photon energy is tuned to values below the optical-phonon frequency; however, owing to the presence of hot carriers, optical-phonon emission is still the predominant relaxation process. For photon energies about twice the value of the Fermi energy, a transition from pump-induced transmission to pump-induced absorption occurs due to the interplay of interband and intraband processes.; Carrier Relaxation in Epitaxial Graphene Photoexcited Near the Dirac Point"

Both temperature and relative humidity induced a reversible change in resonant frequency, attributed to the temperature-dependent properties of Si and to a change in adsorbed water layer. The excellent precision in resonant frequency measurement (0.02 Hz, or 0.5 ppm) allowed precise calculation of the changes in adsorbed water layer thickness over the specimen surface. The increase in water thickness with relative humidity was a function of temperature and could not be described with simple multimolecular adsorption theories such as the BET theory. A likely explanation is the presence of hydrocarbon contaminants on the Si surface. Guidelines are provided to accurately measure the influence of temperature and relative humidity on the adsorbed water layer thickness on micron-scale Si surfaces, using this technique.

However, the variability of PV energy increases the cost to utilize it. This increased cost is partially shouldered by imbalance penalties assigned to the plant owner. Energy storage and forecasting services are two techniques that have been proposed to reduce the penalties. This paper quantifies the level of energy storage and forecasting necessary to reduce, or firm, the intra-hour variability of a PV plant. It also assesses the economics of using a battery energy storage system (BESS) to firm output, finding that more than a 90% cost reduction is required to justify deployment of a BESS.

000297648000001	X	"Background: During Drosophila development, titers of the steroid ecdysone trigger and maintain temporal and tissue specific biological transitions. Decades of evidence reveal that the ecdysone response is both unique to specific tissues and distinct among developmental timepoints. To achieve this diversity in response, the several isoforms of the Ecdysone Receptor, which transduce the hormone signal to the genome level, are believed to interact with tissue specific cofactors. To date, little is known about the identity of these cofactor interactions; therefore, we conducted a bioinformatics informed, RNAi luciferase reporter screen against a subset of putative candidate cofactors identified through an in silico proteome screen. Candidates were chosen based on criteria obtained from bioinformatic consensus of known nuclear receptor cofactors and homologs, including amino acid sequence motif content and context. Results: The bioinformatics pre-screen of the Drosophila melanogaster proteome was successful in identifying an enriched putative candidate gene cohort. Over 80% of the genes tested yielded a positive hit in our reporter screen. We have identified both cell type specific and common cofactors which appear to be necessary for proper ecdysone induced gene regulation. We have determined that certain cofactors act as co-repressors to reduce target gene expression, while others act as co-activators to increase target gene expression. Interestingly, we find that a few of the cofactors shared among cell types have a reversible roles to function as co-repressors in certain cell types while in other cell types they serve as co-activators. Lastly, these proteins are highly conserved, with higher order organism homologs also harboring the LXXLL steroid receptor interaction domains, suggesting a highly conserved mode of steroid cell target specificity. Conclusions: In conclusion, we submit these cofactors as novel components of the ecdysone signaling pathway in order to further elucidate the dynamics of steroid specificity.; Identification of common and cell type specific LXXLL motif EcR cofactors using a bioinformatics refined candidate RNAi screen in Drosophila melanogaster cell lines"
000297938600010	X	"Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) SiN films are widely used as antireflection (AR) coating for silicon solar cells and particularly for multi-crystalline solar cells for hydrogen passivation of bulk defects. In this paper, the detailed optical properties of various SiN films and their effect on silicon solar cell efficiency in air and under glass is evaluated by a combination of Monte-Carlo geometrical ray tracing program, Sunrays, and a device modeling program PC1D. Maximum module power under glass and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulation is used as the figure of merit for optimizing the index and thickness of the SiN films. Simulations are categorized by surface morphology (planar or textured) and ambient (air or glass). SiN films with refractive index (n) in the range of 2.03-2.42 are used for this study. It is found that although n = 2.03 is not the optimum index in terms of reflectance under glass (n = 1.5), it produces maximum cell or module efficiency under glass. This is because n = 2.03 film produces much higher cell efficiency (17.9%) in air, therefore, even after a significant optical encapsulation loss of 0.8% in absolute efficiency, the cell efficiency remains highest (17.1%) under glass. In contrast SiN film with an index of 2.4 produces only 0.5% air to glass efficiency loss but due to the low starting efficiency of 17% in air; the final cell efficiency under glass is only 16.5%. In addition, texturing provides a larger window of thickness around the optimum without affecting the optical performance. Similar analysis done for planar cells indicate that optimum index for highest module power is 2.20. This is because reflection is much higher in planar cells, therefore higher index can be tolerated before loss due to absorption in SiN exceeds the gain in reflectance under glass.

In this paper, we present a new approach to scaffold fabrication by combining the solid-state foaming and the immiscible polymer-blending method. The proposed approach has the advantage of being versatile and able to create a wide range of pore size and porosity. The proposed method is studied with polylactic acid (PLA) and polystyrene (PS) blends. The interconnected porous structure was created by first foaming the PLA/PS blend and then extracting the PS phase. The solid-state foaming experiments were conducted under various conditions to achieve the desired pore sizes. It is shown that the PS phase of the PLA/PS blend can be extracted much faster in the foamed samples and the pore size of the scaffolds can be easily controlled with proper gas foaming parameters. The average pore size achieved in the foaming process ranged from 20 to 70 mu m. After PS extraction, both pore size and porosity can be further improved. For example, the pore size and porosity increased from 48 mu m and 49% to 59 mu m and 67%, respectively, after the PS extraction process. The fabricated porous scaffolds were used to culture human osteoblast cells. Cells grew well and gradually formed a fibrous structure.

According to our results, changing the arrangement of the oxygen atoms of the benzobisoxzoles from the cis to trans orientation slightly stabilized both the HOMO and LUMO levels, whereas replacing the oxygen atoms in trans-BBO with sulfur atoms only stabilized the HOMO level.

In this paper, the performance and the energy dissipation of graphene spin interconnects in a nonlocal spin-torque (NLST) circuit are compared against those of the CMOS circuit at the end of the silicon technology roadmap (technology year 2020). The interconnect-oriented limitations of the NLST circuit are quantified through exhaustive simulations. The impact of the electron scattering at the edges of the graphene nanoribbon (GNR) on the speed and the energy dissipation of the NLST circuit are evaluated. It is found that, if the edges in the GNR scatter electrons with a 100% probability, then the delay of the interconnect in the NLST circuit is 10x higher than its value at perfectly passivated GNR edges for an interconnect with a length of 100 gate pitches and a width of 14 nm. The scattering of electrons at the GNR edges leads to inefficient spin injection in the interconnect, which increases the energy dissipation of the NLST circuit. Energy versus delay landscapes of the NLST circuit and the CMOS circuit are compared. It is found that the energy versus delay of the NLST circuit exhibits a minimum in energy, which is in striking in contrast with the energy-versus-delay behavior of the CMOS circuit.; Graphene Nanoribbon Spin Interconnects for Nonlocal Spin-Torque Circuits: Comparison of Performance and Energy Per Bit With CMOS Interconnects"

A crucial component of creating transgenic switchgrass is having the capability of transforming the explants with DNA sequences of interest using vector constructs.

However, little is known about the role of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, SOD2) in the neointima formation following vascular injury. SOD2 in the mitochondria plays an important role in cellular defense against oxidative damage. Because of its subcellular localization, SOD2 is considered the first line of defense against oxidative stress and plays a central role in metabolizing superoxide. Because mitochondria are the most important sources of superoxide anion, we speculated that SOD2 may have therapeutic benefits in preventing vascular remodeling. In this study, we used a rat carotid artery balloon-injury model and an adenoviral gene delivery approach to test the hypothesis that SOD2 suppresses vascular lesion formation. SOD2 was activated along with the progression of neointima formation in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Depletion of SOD2 by RNA interference markedly promoted the lesion formation, whereas SOD2 overexpression suppressed the injury-induced neointima formation via attenuation of migration and proliferation of VSMCs. SOD2 exerts its inhibitory effect on VSMC migration induced by angiotensin II by scavenging superoxide anion and suppressing the phosphorylation of Akt. Our data indicate that SOD2 is a negative modulator of vascular lesion formation after injury. Therefore, SOD2 augmentation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the prevention of lesion formation in proliferative vascular diseases such as restenosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Boundary elements act via diverse mechanisms making accurate feature-based computational predictions difficult. Therefore, we developed an unbiased algorithm that predicts the locations of human boundary elements based on the genomic distributions of chromatin and transcriptional states, as opposed to any intrinsic characteristics that they may possess. Application of our algorithm to ChIP-seq data for histone modifications and RNA Pol II-binding data in human CD4(+) T cells resulted in the prediction of 2542 putative chromatin boundary elements genome wide. Predicted boundary elements display two distinct features: first, position-specific open chromatin and histone acetylation that is coincident with the recruitment of sequence-specific DNA-binding factors such as CTCF, EVI1 and YYI, and second, a directional and gradual increase in histone lysine methylation across predicted boundaries coincident with a gain of expression of non-coding RNAs, including examples of boundaries encoded by tRNA and other non-coding RNA genes.

However, significant challenges arise from the difficulty of examining the interface, which is buried in a composite film. In this paper, we probed exciton dissociation at a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/ZnO bulk heterojunction interface treated with thiol molecules and charge-transport properties in P3HT of the composite film using field effect transistor (FET) devices. The role of thiol modification of ZnO in charge transfer and charge transport within the bulk heterojunction interface was addressed through comparison of the threshold voltage and the FET mobility between P3HT/thiol-ZnO and P3HT/ZnO FETs. Attachment of thiol molecules onto the ZnO surface induced a larger photoinduced threshold voltage shift than that for an FET with pristine ZnO, indicating that more excitons were dissociated within the P3HT/ZnO composite film. The origin of this effect is discussed through the relationship between the increased interfacial area between P3HT and thiol-ZnO, inferred from surface morphology, and structural ordering of P3HT at the interface. The charge carrier transport properties of P3HT in the composite film are separated from charge transfer, and found to depend on the presence of thiol, offering information on carrier scattering/trapping at the interface.

The application of the produced carbons in EDLCs based on IL electrolyte showed specific capacitance approaching 300 F g-1, which is unprecedented for carbon materials, and 58% performance improvement after 10 000 chargedischarge cycles at the very high current density of 10 A g-1. The remarkable characteristics of the produced materials and the capability of the fabricated EDLCs to operate safely in a wide electrochemical window at elevated temperatures, suggest that the proposed synthesis route offers excellent potential for large-scale material production for EDLC use in electric vehicles and industrial applications.; Polypyrrole-Derived Activated Carbons for High-Performance Electrical Double-Layer Capacitors with Ionic Liquid Electrolyte"
000300481100005	X	"Small RNAs target invaders for silencing in the CRISPR-Cas pathways that protect bacteria and archaea from viruses and plasmids. The CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) contain sequence elements acquired from invaders that guide CRISPR-associated (Gas) proteins back to the complementary invading DNA or RNA. Here, we have analyzed essential features of the crRNAs associated with the Cas RAMP module (Cmr) effector complex, which cleaves targeted RNAs. We show that Cmr crRNAs contain an 8 nucleotide 5' sequence tag (also found on crRNAs associated with other CRISPR-Cas pathways) that is critical for crRNA function and can be used to engineer crRNAs that direct cleavage of novel targets. We also present data that indicate that the Cmr complex cleaves an endogenous complementary RNA in Pyrococcus furiosus, providing direct in vivo evidence of RNA targeting by the CRISPR-Cas system. Our findings indicate that the CRISPR RNA-Cmr protein pathway may be exploited to cleave RNAs of interest.; Essential Features and Rational Design of CRISPR RNAs that Function with the Cas RAMP Module Complex to Cleave RNAs"
000300504800005	X	"Graphene electronics was officially invented at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2003 after experimental and theoretical research on graphene properties starting from 2001. This paper focuses on the motivation and events leading to the invention of graphene electronics, as well as on recent developments. Graphene electronics was originally conceived as a new electronics paradigm to incorporate the room-temperature ballistic and coherent properties of carbon nanotubes in a patternable electronic material. Graphene on silicon carbide was chosen as the most suitable material. Other electronics schemes, involving transferred (exfoliated and chemical vapor deposition-produced) graphitic materials, that operate in the diffusive regime may not be competitive with standard methods and may therefore not significantly impact electronics. In recent years, epitaxial graphene has improved to the point where graphene electronics according to the original concept appears to be within reach. Beyond electronics, epitaxial graphene research has led to important developments in graphene physics in general and has become a leading platform for graphene science as well.; The invention of graphene electronics and the physics of epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide"
000300512400001	X	"Two new fields are introduced to the sensor community: strained induced piezotronics for smart CMOS and a nanogenerator that harvests mechanical energy for powering nanosystems. Fundamentally, due to the polarization of ions in a crystal that has non-central symmetry, such as ZnO, GaN and InN, a piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) is created in the crystal by applying a stress. We have replaced the externally applied gate voltage to a CMOS field effect transistor by the strain induced piezopotential as a ""gate"" voltage to tune/control the charge transport from source to drain. The devices fabricated by this principle are called piezotronics, with applications in strain/force/pressure triggered/controlled electronic devices, sensors and logic units. The principle of harvesting irregular mechanical energy by the nanogenerator relies on the piezopotenital driven transient flow of electrons in external load, which can be resulted from body motion, muscle stretching, breathing, tiny mechanical vibration/disturbance, sonic wave etc. As of today, a gentle straining can output 1-3 V at an instant output power of similar to 2 mu W from an integrated nanogenerator of a very thin sheet of 1 cm(2) in size. This technology has the potential applications for power MEMS/NEMS that requires a power in the mu W to mW range.

000301031500001	X	"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are important molecules in the stress response of organisms from prokaryotes to mammals, and thus may be useful biomarkers for environmental stress. Here we characterize the functional roles of genes belonging to four distinct families of HSPs (hsp40, hsp60, hsp70, and hsp90) in the monogonont rotifer Brachionus manjavacas. Because B. manjavacas inhabits ponds of varying thermal regimes, including ephemeral ponds that may experience temperature fluctuations, HSP-mediated thermotolerance likely is important to its survival and adaptation. Using interference RNA (RNAi), we provide the first conclusive evidence that HSPs are required for rotifer survival following heat stress. Effective RNAi-mediated suppression of all hsp genes except hsp90 was verified via quantitative PCR. Hsp40, hsp60, and hsp70 are required for rotifer thermotolerance (P<0.05); however, our data do not indicate hsp90 is essential. Quantitative PCR further revealed immediate up-regulation of hsp40 mRNA following heat stress. Additionally, we demonstrated expression of hsp40 mRNA in multiple tissues using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Our characterization of mRNA expression and functional roles for four distinct hsp genes provides a baseline for molecular-level comparisons of the stress response of rotifers with other taxonomic groups, and the technique for in-depth studies of the role of specific genes in rotifer stress responses. Considering the potential for ambient temperatures to impact species survival, competitive interactions, and body size of individuals, thermotolerance may be an important influence on zooplankton community structure.

We observe both intra-band transitions between neighboring hole/electron LLs, as well as inter-band transitions between hole and electron LLs, all proportional to root B in energy. The lack of precise scaling between different LL transitions and the unexpectedly large energy shifts as a function of the LL filling factor near the charge neutrality point suggest considerable contributions of many-body effects to the infrared transition energies.; Cyclotron Resonance near the Charge Neutrality Point of Graphene"
000301081400045	X	"Ideal outcomes in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine involve biomaterials that can enhance cell differentiation and production of local factors for natural tissue regeneration without the use of systemic drugs. Biomaterials typically used in tissue engineering applications include polymeric scaffolds that mimic the three-dimensional structural environment of the native tissue, but these are often functionalized with proteins or small peptides to improve their biological performance. For bone applications, titanium implants, or more appropriately the TiO2 passive oxide layer formed on their surface, have been shown to enhance osteoblast differentiation in vitro and to promote osseointegration in vivo. In this study we evaluated the effect on osteoblast differentiation of pure TiO2 nanofiber meshes with different surface microroughness and nanofiber diameters, prepared by the electrospinning method. MG63 cells were seeded on TiO2 meshes, and cell number, differentiation markers and local factor production were analyzed. The results showed that cells grew throughout the entire surfaces and with similar morphology in all groups. Cell number was sensitive to surface microroughness, whereas cell differentiation and local factor production was regulated by both surface roughness and nanofiber diameter. These results indicate that scaffold structural cues alone can be used to drive cell differentiation and create an osteogenic environment without the use of exogenous factors.

000301236700003	X	An approach for microfabricating precisely defined spherical 3-D domes through a simple low-temperature polymer reflow process was developed. Release of a thin metal film patterned over the domed structure was accomplished by the removal of the underlying polymer using two different methods: dry thermal decomposition and wet supercritical release. The domed shape impacted the effect of stiction during the release step and assisted in the release of large millimeter-size film geometries. The dome and release procedures were used to fabricate an experimental test specimen that functions as either a tensile or interfacial fracture test for thin films on rigid substrates. Other potential applications of the domed metal structures such as compliant electrical interconnects are discussed.; Domed and Released Thin-Film Construct-An Approach for Material Characterization and Compliant Interconnects
000301328800020	X	"Cmr2 is the largest and an essential subunit of a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex (the Cmr complex) that cleaves foreign RNA to protect prokaryotes from invading genetic elements. Cmr2 is thought to be the catalytic subunit of the effector complex because of its N-terminal HD nuclease domain. Here, however, we report that the HD domain of Cmr2 is not required for cleavage by the complex in vitro. The 2.3 angstrom crystal structure of Pyrococcus furiosus Cmr2 (lacking the HD domain) reveals two adenylyl cyclase-like and two a-helical domains. The adenylyl cyclase-like domains are arranged as in homodimeric adenylyl cyclases and bind ADP and divalent metals. However, mutagenesis studies show that the metal- and ADP-coordinating residues of Cmr2 are also not critical for cleavage by the complex. Our findings suggest that another component provides the catalytic function and that the essential role by Cmr2 does not require the identified ADP- or metal-binding or HD domains in vitro.; Structure of the Cmr2 Subunit of the CRISPR-Cas RNA Silencing Complex"

000301639800004	X	"Successful repair of the injured brain is critical, as traumatic brain injury pathology often involves a secondary cascade of insults that may ultimately lead to worsened neurologic dysfunction. Damage is balanced by the brain's attempt to repair itself, the genetic profile of the person, underlying health issues, and age, among other factors. The challenge in using a tissue engineering approach to repair and regeneration is centered at the heterogeneous and complex environment, variables that are difficult to measure and interpret. The brain must be in a state that minimizes rejection, inflammation, immune response, and donor cell death to maximize the intended benefit. Tissue engineering, using a bioactive based scaffold to both counter some of the hostile factors and to chaperone donor cells into the brain, has merit, yet the complexity of transplanting a combination biologic construct to the brain has yet to be successfully transferred to the clinic. Several options, such as cell source, scaffold composition, as well as delivery methods will be discussed.; Stem Cells and Bioactive Scaffolds as a Treatment for Traumatic Brain Injury"
000301684800006	X	"Scaffolds constitute an essential structural component in tissue engineering of a vascular substitute for small grafts by playing a significant role in integrating the overall tissue constructs. The microstructure and mechanical properties of such scaffolds are important parameters to promote further cellular activities and neo-tissue development. Cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs), an abundant, biocompatible material, could potentially constitute an acceptable candidate in scaffolding of a tissue-engineered vessel. Inspired by the advantages of cellulose and its derivatives, we have designed a biomaterial comprising CNWs embedded in a matrix of cellulose acetate propionate to fabricate a fully bio-based scaffold. To ensure uniform distribution, CNWs were delicately extracted from a multi-stage process and dispersed in an acetone suspension prior to the composite fabrication. Comparable to carbon nanotubes or kevlar, CNWs impart significant strength and directional rigidity even at 0.2 wt% and almost double that at only 3.0 wt%. To ensure the accuracy of our experimental data and to predict the unusual reinforcing effect of CNWs in a cellulose-based composite, homogenization schemes such as the mean field approach and the percolation technique were also investigated. Based on these comparisons, the tendency of CNWs to interconnect with one another through strong hydrogen bonding confirmed the formation of a three-dimensional rigid percolating network, fact which imparted an excellent mechanical stability to the entire structure at such low filler contents. Hence, our fibrous porous microstructure with improved mechanical properties could introduce a potential scaffold to withstand the physiological pressure and to mimic the profile features of native extracellular matrix in a human vessel. We believe that our nanohybrid design not only could expand the biomedical applications of renewable cellulose-based materials but also could provide a potential scaffold candidate in tissue engineering of small diameter grafts.
